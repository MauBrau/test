This could be my little
book about love
if I wrote it--
but my good demon said:
'Lay off documents!'
Everybody was watching me
burn my books--
I swung my liberty torch
happy as a gestapo brute;
the only thing I wanted to save
was a scar
a burn or two--
but my good demon said:
'Lay off documents!
The fire's not important!'
The pile was safely blazing.
I went home to take a bath.
I phoned my grandmother.
She is suffering from arthritis.
'Keep well,' I said, 'don't mind the pain.'
'You neither,' she said.
Hours later I wondered
did she mean
don't mind my pain
or don't mind her pain?
Whereupon my good demon said:
'Is that all you can do?'
Well was it?
Was it all I could do?
There was the old lady
eating alone, thinking about
Prince Albert, Flanders Field,
Kishenev, her fingers too sore 
for TV knobs; 
but how could I get there ? 
The books were gone 
my address lists-- 
My good demon said again: 
'Lay off documents! 
You know how to get there!' 
And suddenly I did! 
I remembered it from memory! 
I found her 
pouring over the royal family tree,
'Grandma,' 
I almost said, 
'you've got it upside down--'
'Take a look,' she said, 
'it only goes to George V.' 
'That's far enough 
you sweet old blood!' 
'You're right!' she sang 
and burned the 
London Illustrated Souvenir 
I did not understand 
the day it was 
till I looked outside 
and saw a fire in every 
window on the street 
and crowds of humans 
crazy to talk 
and cats and dogs and birds 
smiling at each other!
